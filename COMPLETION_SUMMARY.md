## ⚠️ Research Limitations

1. **API Rate Limits:** Brave Search limited to ~1 request/second
2. **Missing Early Documentation:** Some 2014-2016 projects have limited online presence
3. **Production Credits:** Music production often lacks public documentation
4. **Commercial Work:** Brand campaigns have limited public attribution
5. **Cover Art:** No images were downloaded (time constraints)

---

## 💡 Recommendations for Phase 2

1. **YouTube API:** For real-time view counts and upload dates
2. **IMDb Pro:** For detailed crew credits
3. **Spotify/Apple Music APIs:** For production credits verification
4. **Archive.org:** For capturing press coverage
5. **Direct Verification:** Some projects need confirmation from Glassface team
