## Research Challenges & Limitations

1. **API Rate Limits:** Brave Search API has strict rate limiting (1 request per second for free tier), which significantly slowed research progress
2. **Missing Video Data:** Some older projects (2014-2016) have limited online documentation
3. **Production Credits:** Music production credits often lack detailed public documentation
4. **View Counts:** YouTube view counts are constantly changing; database reflects views at time of research
5. **Commercial Work:** Brand campaigns often have limited public information about specific Glassface contributions

---

## Recommendations for Further Research

1. **Manual Verification:** Some projects would benefit from direct verification with Glassface or his team
2. **YouTube API:** For real-time view counts and upload date verification
3. **IMDb Pro:** For detailed crew credits on major projects
4. **Spotify/Apple Music APIs:** For verified music production credits and streaming data
5. **Archive.org:** For capturing press coverage that may be removed or updated
6. **Cargo Collective Archive:** Glassface's original portfolio site contains additional early work
